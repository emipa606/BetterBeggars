Better Beggars enhances the beggars added in the Ideology DLC.

# Features



-  Change how much beggars will ask for (vanilla is a 0.85x multiplier on colony wealth, this mod allows you to change it from 0.1 up to 2x).
-  Change what items beggars ask for.
-  Beggars have a chance to send a delayed reward if you help them out.
-  New Event: Beggar addicts who will come and ask for drugs to help their addictions.
-  New Event: Beggars who are being chased by raiders, if you agree to help they will join you for a few days before leaving.



# Planned Features



-  Larger list of items to choose from.
-  More beggar events.



# FAQ

Q: Can this mod be added to an existing save?
A: From my testing yes, but no promises.

Q: Can this mod be safely removed from a save?
A: From my testing yes.

# Compatibility

Should be compatible with all mods as long as they do not change the vanilla beggars quest or vanilla item defs. If you find compatibility issues let me know and I will try my best to sort them out!
